After making the environment (pretty straightforward to do so), just do "python run_app.py" to run the app.

You also need a config, in the config folder make a "config.yaml" in the way that I share on slack with my key to run it. 

To add a tool add it to the agent.py as a function and explain in the prompt in prompt.py in a similar way that I did how to do run it and the output.
